User - entry point.
Every user has their collections. 
1) dates of migraine one document should contain this info:  
MigraineEntry {
    date: string;
    startTime: string;
    endTime: string | "Ongoing";
    painIntensity: number;
    triggers: string; 
    medication: string;
    symptoms: string;
    notes: string;
}

2) when user register they have possibility to add their own triggers, medication, symptoms to preexisting ones. So it should be initially arrays/documents with triggers(alcohol, weather changing, lack of the sleep), medication (paracetomol, ibuprofen), symptoms (headache, nausea, aura, light sensitivity). And when user add a new migraine episode and, in the triggers for instance there is no "stress"-trigger and they want to add this one, user can write this trigger and it also automatically will be added to triggers document. So next time , whe user add new migraine eposode, they can chose from triggers - (alcohol, weather changing, lack of the sleep, stress).
